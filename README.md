# Supported Themes

If you're implementing a new theme based on the `symbiote-minimalist` theme, you'll likely want to carry through any javascript requirements that are defined through code. The following will be needed:

```yaml
PageControllerThemeExtension:
  supported_themes:
    - 'your-theme'
```
